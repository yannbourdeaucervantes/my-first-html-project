      <h2>What is Bio-Architecture?</h2>
      <p>Bio-architecture is a philosophy of design that prioritizes harmony between human living spaces and the natural world. It embraces organic forms, sustainability, and emotional well-being. Unlike conventional architecture, bio-architecture avoids harsh angles and materials that isolate us from nature.</p>
      <p>As a pioneer of this movement, Javier Senosiain's architecture resembles caves, shells, and plants—structures that feel like extensions of the earth rather than impositions upon it.</p>

      <h2>Why Bio-Architecture Matters Today</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reconnects us with nature:</strong> Promotes mental and physical well-being.</li>
        <li><strong>Supports sustainability:</strong> Uses eco-friendly materials and passive systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Fosters creativity and freedom:</strong> Breaks away from rigid, boxed-in thinking.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In an era of climate urgency and growing urban alienation, bio-architecture offers a deeply human and ecological alternative to traditional construction methods.</p>
